<h1>Simulation of flows past a cylinder at various values of Reynolds number with OpenFOAM</h1>

This set of simulations consists of 4 simulations that use the same geometry and mesh (excluding the LES one) and different values of the kinematic visosity $\mu$\, and thus achieving different values for the Reynolds number <strong><em>Re</em></strong>.
