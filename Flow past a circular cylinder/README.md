<h1>Simulation of flows past a cylinder at various values of Reynolds number with OpenFOAM</h1>

This set of simulations consists of 4 simulations that use the same geometry and mesh, but different values of the kinematic visosity $\mu$\, and thus achieving different values for the Reynolds number <strong><em>Re</em></strong>.

Flow around a cylinder and the phenomenae that occur at various values of <strong><em>Re</em></strong> is a well known canonical case in fluid mechanics. I did theese simulations to solidify what i learned about CFD and get some practice in OpenFOAM. I ran simulations at <strong><em>Re</em></strong> values of: 2, 20, 100 and 4400. The following image found in [this paper] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282655240_Effect_of_Free_stream_turbulence_on_flow_past_a_circular_cylinder) ilustrates the resulting phenomenae.
