<h1>Simulation of flows past a cylinder at various values of Reynolds number with OpenFOAM</h1>

This set of simulations consists of 4 simulations that use the same geometry and mesh, but different values of the kinematic visosity $\mu$\, and thus achieving different values for the Reynolds number <strong><em>Re</em></strong>.

Flow around a cylinder and the phenomenae that occur at various values of <strong><em>Re</em></strong> is a well known canonical case in fluid mechanics. I did theese simulations to solidify what i learned about CFD and get some practice in OpenFOAM.
